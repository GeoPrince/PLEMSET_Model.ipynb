# PLEMSET_Model.ipynb
The PLEMSET model is like a toolkit that helps us understand all the different ways parks benefit people and the environment. It looks at things like how parks help us stay healthy, learn new things, support wildlife, make us feel good, preserve culture and history, and even boost the local economy through tourism.
